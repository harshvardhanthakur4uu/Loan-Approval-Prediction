# Loan-Approval-Prediction

📌 Loan Approval Prediction<br>
🔍 Project Summary

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on historical data from 4000+ applicants. It involves a full data science pipeline including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and performance comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms. This helps in automating and optimizing loan approval processes for financial institutions.
📊 Tools & Technologies Used

1. Programming Language: Python<br>

2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn<br>

3. Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)<br>

4. Environment: Jupyter Notebook<br>

🚀 Project Highlights

1. 4000+ loan applicants’ data analyzed to identify key features influencing approval decisions.<br>

2. Performed comprehensive EDA and data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.<br>

3. Built and evaluated four classification models, with Random Forest achieving 98% accuracy.<br>

3. Used confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for performance evaluation.<br>
   
4. Derived actionable insights to aid in data-driven decision-making for loan approval processes.<br>
